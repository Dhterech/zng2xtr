# Zng2Xtr
This is an WIP tool for extracting XTR files based on PWF2INT.

## How to use?
Run `zng2xtr x (xtr file) (folder to extract)` to dump all the contents of the XTR into a folder. Then, use other known PTR2 tools to extract other assets of the game

## How to compile?
Run `cmake` to generate make files and `make` to build

## Todo
1. Mimic how the game actually extracts the file
2. Make a import function
